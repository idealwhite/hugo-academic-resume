abstract: Graph convolutional network (GCN) has become popular in various
  natural language processing (NLP) tasks with its superiority in long-term and
  non-consecutive word interactions. However, existing single-hop graph
  reasoning in GCN may miss some important non-consecutive dependencies. In this
  study, we de fine the spectral graph convolutional network with the high-order
  dynamic Chebyshev ap proximation (HDGCN), which augments the multi-hop graph
  reasoning by fusing messages aggregated from direct and long-term dependencies
  into one convolutional layer. To alleviate the over-smoothing in high-order
  Chebyshev approximation, a multi-vote based cross attention (MVCAttn) with
  linear computation complexity is also proposed. The empirical results on four
  transductive and inductive NLP tasks and the ablation study verify the
  efficacy of the proposed model.
